# Peaceful Space
This webapp allows users to list peaceful places around different cities. There are no specific app or webapp which help users to find peaceful places where they can meditate or spend some quality time. So I built this prototype to solve such problem.

### Tech Stack
This is a full stack web application. Front-end is built with vanilla JavaScript, using Django for the Back-end, used Imagekit API to host the images and SQLite database to store the entries. Since SQLite comes default with Django so used that to add places with the help of Django ORM.
#### Front-end
HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
#### Back-end
Python, Django
#### Third party API
Imagekit
